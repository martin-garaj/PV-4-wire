This is an ad-hoc solution for replacing high-precision 4-wire measurement setup by multiple simple instruments orchestrated by PC running a Python script.


There might not be any use for this anymore, but since the interfaces for the devices change by glacial pace, the scripts and control mechanism are and will be relevant for several more years, maybe decades.


Also, not to toot my own flute, but replacing a high-precision machine worth 100k ~ 200k Euro by a set of (relatively) cheap instruments that due to the PC control match the precision and tripple the measurement range, is an **achievemnt** for me. Not to mention, that this was done hastily, since the original machine broke unexpectadly during my short-term exchange during my PhD.
